I prefer the portfolio at the tangent point rather than the the MVP since the investor can have the largest utility at the tangent portfolio though it is more risky than the MVP. Based on the therom of economics, people make decisions based how much utility they have and risk is less important so it would be better to select the tangent portfolio.
