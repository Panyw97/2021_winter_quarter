(i)

The duration of bond A is
$$
D_A = \frac{15/(1+10\%)}{118.95}\times1+\frac{15/(1+10\%)^2}{118.95}\times2+\frac{15/(1+10\%)^3}{118.95}\times3+\frac{15/(1+1\%)^4}{118.95}\times4+\frac{115/(1+10\%)^5}{118.95}\times5=3.95
$$
Similarly, we can find the duration of bond B is
$$
D_B = \frac{15/(1+10\%)}{130.72}\times1+\frac{15/(1+10\%)^2}{130.72}\times2+\frac{15/(1+10\%)^3}{130.72}\times3+...+\frac{115/(1+10\%)^{10}}{130.72}\times10=6.28
$$
Suppose the proportion of bond A in the portfolio is $x$ and the proportion of bond B is $1-x$, then we want the duration of the portfolio to be 5 years.
$$
x\times3.95+(1-x)\times6.28=5\\
x = 0.549
$$
So the proportion of bond A in the portfolio is 54.9% and the value of bond A in the portfolio is $\$620901.16\times54.9\%=\$340874.7$, which is $\$340874.7/\$118.95=2865.7$ units of bond A. Similarly, we should buy $\$620901.16\times(1-54.9\%)/\$130.72=2142.2$ units of bond B.

(ii)

Based on (i), we know the cash flow of the coupon of bond A is $2865.7\times\$15=\$42985.5$. Similarly, the cash flow of the coupon of bond B is $2142.2\times\$15=\$32133$.

We can easily calculate the accumulated value of these cash flows at the end of the fifth year as
$$
(\$42985.5+\$32133)\times(1+r)^4+...+(\$42985.5+\$32133)\times(1+r)+(\$42985.5+\$32133)+FV_A\times N_A+ FV_B\times N_B+\frac{$32133}{1+r}+...+\frac{\$32133}{(1+r)^5}
$$
When $r=10\%$, we have the future value in the fifth year as $1,000,000.

If $r=\%9$, we have the future value in the fifth year as $1,000,347.

If $r=11\%$, we have the future value in the fifth year as $1,000,283.

Clearly, the three future values are close.
