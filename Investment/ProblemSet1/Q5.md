(a)  Calculate the no-arbitrage price of the coupon bond today.

For the six-month zero-coupon bond, the yield to maturity $r_1 = \frac{$100}{$99.46}-1=0.0054$. Similarly, the yield to maturity of the one-year zero- coupon bond $r_2 = (\frac{$100}{$97.23})^{\frac{1}{2}}-1 = 0.0141$ and  the yield to maturity of the 18-month zero- coupon bond $r_3 = (\frac{$100}{$90.50})^{\frac{1}{3}}-1 = 0.0338$.

So we have the non-arbitrage price of the new coupon 
$$
P = \frac{4.5}{1+0.0054}+\frac{4.5}{(1+0.0141)^2}+\frac{100+4.5}{(1+0.0338)^3}=$103.4332
$$
(b)  Calculate the implied forward rates in this economy.

 Forward rate after one year $f_{1,2} = \frac{(1+r_2)^2}{1+r_1}-1=\frac{(1+0.0141)^2}{1+0.0054}-1=0.0229$.

Forward rate after 18 months $f_{2,3} = \frac{(1+r_3)^3}{(1+r_2)^2}-1=\frac{(1+0.0338)^3}{(1+0.0141)^2}-1=0.0744$

(c)  If the liquidity preference theory is correct and there exists a liquidity premium of 0.5% per period, what is the marketâ€™s expectation of the price the bond will sell for in one year? 1 year = 2 periods here.

 If the liquidity preference theory holds and the liquidity premium is 0.5%, the expectation of the interest rate of each period is:
$$
E(r_2) = 0.0744-0.005 = 0.0694 \\
E(r_1)  = 0.0229-0.005 = 0.0179 
$$
So the market price is:
$$
Market Price = \frac{FV+CP}{1+E(r_2)}=$97.71
$$
